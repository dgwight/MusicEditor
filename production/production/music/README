README: HW7
Dylan Wight + Dorian Franklin

To run call MusicEditor with the filename and then "composite" as arguments

Use "Q" and "W" to decrease/increase the duration.
Use "A" and "S" to decrease/increase the volume.

MODEL CHANGES:
changed Note to have a Boolean isHit value so that I did not need a separate datastucture
 in SongImpl to keep track of sustained note. Now when a note is added a "hit note" is added
  at the time specified and  the  required sustained notes are added after.

added a volume field to Note. 


VIEW CHANGES:
add protected int beat field to GUIViewImpl, this is used to determine the location of the
 redline.

add protected void play method to GUIViewImpl, this is used to increment the location of the
 redline, as well as the shift the view right when the redline hits the edge of the window.

added private boolean hasT1 field in CombinedView to
 combat exceptions when start is pressed multiple times

 nested class TimerTaskThingy into Combined view and made it private, too prevent implentation
  details from leaking

add 3 lines of code,161-163 in GUIViewImpl to draw the redline;

changed starting value of beat field in GUIViewImpl to -5, 
so that it is only draw on screen during the CompositeView

added an addKeyListener method to CombinedView, this was so runnables that involve the 
CombinedView could work

added boolean hasCurrent to GUIViewImpl to represent whether the user is currently editing
 a Note

added private int currentTime field to GUIViewImpl, to represent whether the start time of
 the current note

added protected getNoteAt(int time, int tone) in Song

add lines in mouseClicked method in GUIViewImpl that allows for a note to be moved

added frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE) in GUIViewPanel, in fix 
midi still playing after the window was closed
